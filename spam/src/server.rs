/// server.rs — axum HTTP router for the lmdb2graphql GraphQL API.
///
/// Provides:
///   - `build_probe_router(ready)` — startup-window surface: mounts ONLY `GET /health`
///     and `GET /ready` (no GraphQL/data routes). Served on the bound TCP listener while
///     the gate chain runs so orchestrators can observe the 503→200 transition (OPS-01,
///     T-05-05-SC: no corpus reachable while `ready=false`).
///   - `build_router(schema, ready)` — mounts `POST /graphql` (GraphQL service),
///     `GET /graphql` (GraphiQL playground), `GET /health` (liveness), and
///     `GET /ready` (readiness) on the same router (Pattern 5 / Pitfall 4 / OPS-01).
///
/// ## Routing
///
/// ```text
///   POST /graphql  →  async-graphql Tower Service (GraphQL::new(schema))
///   GET  /graphql  →  graphiql handler → Html(GraphiQLSource)
///   GET  /health   →  health_handler → 200 always (liveness — OPS-01)
///   GET  /ready    →  ready_handler  → 200 if ready flag is true, 503 otherwise (OPS-01)
/// ```
///
/// ## Pitfall 4 (RESEARCH.md)
///
/// `post_service` is a method on `MethodRouter`, NOT a free function in `axum::routing`.
/// Pattern: `get(handler).post_service(svc)` — chains on `MethodRouter` after `get(...)`.
/// Using `Router::new().route("/graphql", post_service(...))` would fail to compile in axum 0.8.
///
/// ## Read-only surface
///
/// The router has no write routes. No Mutation type in the schema (T-04-WRITE/API-06).
/// GraphiQL and introspection are enabled — this is a read-only adapter; no credentials are at risk.
///
/// ## Layer ordering note (WR-02-LAYER)
///
/// `.layer(RequestBodyLimitLayer::new(...))` must be the OUTERMOST layer (applied after
/// `.with_state()`). In axum 0.8, layers wrap the entire service stack in definition order;
/// placing the body-limit layer last (outermost) ensures it fires before any handler sees the body.

///
/// `ready` is an `Arc<AtomicBool>` initialized `false` in `main.rs` and set `true` only
/// after all startup gates pass (`run_comparator_self_check` succeeds). Using `AtomicBool`
/// (not `Mutex<bool>` or `RwLock<bool>`) avoids lock contention on every probe — the readiness
/// state is a single bit that only ever transitions false → true (per RESEARCH anti-patterns).
///
/// ## Layer ordering (WR-02-LAYER)
///
/// `.with_state(ready)` injects the `Arc<AtomicBool>` into the router state.
/// `.layer(RequestBodyLimitLayer::new(...))` is applied AFTER `.with_state()` so it is the
/// outermost layer — enforces the body cap at the Content-Length/body-stream level regardless
/// of extractor, returning 413 Payload Too Large before the body is buffered.
/// Build the probe-only router for the startup gate window (OPS-01 / T-05-05-SC).
///
/// This router is served on the bound TCP listener BEFORE the gate chain runs, giving
/// orchestrators a real HTTP surface to poll during startup. It mounts:
/// - `GET /health` → `health_handler`: 200 always (liveness)
/// - `GET /ready`  → `ready_handler`: 503 while `ready=false`; 200 after `store(true)`
///
/// Critically, this router does NOT mount `/graphql` and does NOT include the GraphQL
/// Tower service or `AppState`. No event data is reachable while `ready=false` — the
/// data/GraphQL surface is only mounted in `build_router` after gates pass (T-05-05-SC).
///
/// No `RequestBodyLimitLayer` is needed here — both handlers accept no request body.
///
/// ## Startup sequence
///
/// In `main.rs`:
/// 1. `let listener = TcpListener::bind(addr).await?;`
/// 2. `let probe = build_probe_router(Arc::clone(&ready)); // ready=false`
/// 3. `tokio::spawn(axum::serve(listener, probe).with_graceful_shutdown(...))`
/// 4. Run gate chain (env open → Meta gates → comparator self-check)
/// 5. On `Ok`: `ready.store(true, Ordering::Release)` → probe now returns 200
/// 6. Graceful-shutdown the probe server; re-bind; serve `build_router`
/// 7. On any gate `Err`: `?` propagates to `main`, process exits non-zero — `/ready` never reaches 200
